Mouse movement to LUA converter packaged in a simple user-friendly GUI.

The intent behind this project was to create a simple way to capture mouse movements to quickly create custom recoil scripts for any game with Logitech GHUB. 

Simply set a hotkey and save location, and begin using. 

Includes sequential naming conventions (ex: file1.lua, file2.lua) for easy sorting. 

If you run into any bugs, let me know.
