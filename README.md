![Mouse input to LUA converter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44911a52-b659-4c4e-89fd-30d3a1efa7f7)

Mouse movement to LUA converter packaged in a simple user-friendly GUI made with Python.

The intent behind this project was to create a simple way to capture mouse movements to quickly create custom recoil scripts for any game with Logitech GHUB. 

Simply set a hotkey (default F2) and save location, and begin using. 

Includes sequential naming conventions (ex: file1.lua, file2.lua) for easy sorting. 

If you run into any bugs, let me know.
